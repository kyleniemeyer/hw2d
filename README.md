# The Hasegawa-Wakatani model of plasma turbulence

This repository contains a reference implementations for the Hasegawa-Wakatani model in two dimensions using Python.
The purpose is to provide a playground for education and scientific purposes: be it testing numerical or machine learning methods, or building related models quicker.

Stable, verified parameters will be published with this repository.

Install a pure NumPy version via
```pip install hw2d```
and to include accelerators like numba, use the following:
